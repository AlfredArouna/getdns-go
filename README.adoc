= GetDNS-Go
Jim Hague <jim@sinodun.com>

A Go wrapper for https://getdnsapi.net/[GetDNS].

This library makes the GetDNS library available to Go callers.

It was written during the IETF 96 Hackathon, largely as an excuse for
a novice Go programmer to learn more Go.

At present it needs review by someone more fluent in Go. It also needs more
documentation. For examples of how to use the library, see the tests in
`getdns_test.go`.
