/*
Package getdns provides a binding to the full-featured getdns library.
getdns implements DNS entry points from a design developed and vetted by
application developers, in an API specification originally edited by
Paul Hoffman. With the development of this API, we intend to offer
application developers a modernized and flexible way to access DNS
security (DNSSEC) and other powerful new DNS features; a particular
hope is to inspire application developers towards innovative security
solutions in their applications.

For more information on getdns, see http://getdnsapi.net.
